vcs.kak
=======

Auto-detect and store the path to the root of the current repository, if any.

When a new buffer is created/opened, the script will try to use the following
Version Control Systems, on after the other:

* `git`
* `svn`
* `hg`
* `bzr`

As soon as a VCS returns a path, indicating that the current buffer was
created within a repository, the variable below is set.

Variables
---------

vcs_name
~~~~~~~~

String holding the name of the VCS detected. Can be one of:

* `git`
* `svn`
* `mercurial`
* `bazaar`

vcs_root_path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

String containing the path to the repository in which the current buffer
was created. This variable only has a value set in the `buffer` scope.

After the script has been loaded, one could use it in subsequent hooks to
apply project-wide settings (c.f. example below).

Examples
--------

Auto-detecting root `tags` files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a `tags` file (for use with the builtin `ctags` support script)
to the `ctagsfiles` option, on buffer creation:

```sh
hook global BufCreate .* %{
    %sh{
        if [ -e "${kak_opt_vcs_root_path}/tags" ]; then
            printf 'set-option -add buffer ctagsfiles %%{%s}\n' "${kak_opt_vcs_root_path}/tags"
        fi
    }
}
```

Highlighting `git` changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Highlighting with a flag the lines that were changed, in a buffer, since
the last `git` commit:

```sh
hook global WinCreate .* %{ evaluate-commands %sh{
    if [ -n "${kak_opt_vcs_root_path}" ]; then
        case "${kak_opt_vcs_name}" in
            git)
                echo "
                    git show-diff
                    hook global BufWritePost %val{buffile} %{git update-diff}
                    hook global BufReload %val{buffile} %{git update-diff}
                    hook global WinDisplay %val{buffile} %{git update-diff}
                ";;
        esac
    fi
} }
```
